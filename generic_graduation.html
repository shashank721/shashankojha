										<!-- <h2 id="content">Welcome to my journey through the world of Electrical and Electronics Engineering!</h2> -->
										<p>
										In 2021, I completed my B.Tech. degree with a CGPA of 7.28 from <a href="https://aktu.ac.in/" target="_blank">Dr. A.P.J. Abdul Kalam Technical University</a> -affiliated college, <a href="https://rrsimt.ac.in/">Rajarshi Rananjay Singh Institute of Management and Technology, Amethi, Uttar Pradesh.</a> </p>
										<p>
											This is the story of how I ventured <i>(to do something or go somewhere new and dangerous, when you are not sure what will happen)</i> into the realm <i>(an area of activity, knowledge or interest)</i> of engineering, fueled by a passion for math and science that has been with me since my school days.
										</p>

										<h3>The Foundation: School Years</h3>
										<p><span class="image left"><img src="/images/graduation01.jpeg" alt="" /></span>My fascination with mathematics and science began in my early school years. The thrill of solving complex problems, understanding the laws of nature, and unraveling the mysteries of science always captured my imagination. It was this childhood curiosity that set the stage for my educational journey.</p>
										<p>During my adolescence (Teenage), I observed a significant upsurge in the demand for skilled professionals, particularly in technical domains. This heightened demand was particularly evident in sectors such as construction, data management, IT industries, and the electrical sector, encompassing infrastructure aspects like generation, transmission, and distribution. My inclination towards the engineering field stemmed from its potential to provide me with opportunities for in-depth exploration within the realms of science and engineering.
										</p>

										<h3>B.Tech. in Electrical and Electronics Engineering</h3>
										<p>In 2017, I embarked on my B.Tech. journey, specializing in Electrical and Electronics Engineering at RRSIMT. The curriculum was rigorous and demanding, but it was also incredibly rewarding. Throughout my undergraduate years, I dived deep into the principles and applications of electrical and electronics engineering, honing my skills in designing, analyzing, and troubleshooting electrical systems. My CGPA of 7.28 reflects the dedication and hard work I put into my studies.
										</p>
										<h3>A Passion for Learning and Exploration</h3>
										<p>What sets me apart is my innate curiosity and passion for learning. I've always been driven by a desire to explore the wonders of science and technology. This curiosity led me to undertake several certification courses to expand my knowledge and skills further. I completed courses such as "Basics of Computer," "PLC Programming and Scada," and "AutoCAD Electrical," etc., which enhanced my understanding of the field and equipped me with practical expertise.
										</p>
										
										<h3>The Path Forward</h3>
										<p>As I look ahead, my journey in the world of Electrical and Electronics Engineering continues. I'm excited about the opportunities that lie ahead, and I'm determined to apply my knowledge and skills to contribute to the ever-evolving landscape of technology and innovation.
